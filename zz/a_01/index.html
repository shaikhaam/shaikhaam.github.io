<h1>Historical  Sculptures</h1> 

<p>
<span style="color:blue";>Sculpture</span>is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving and modelling, in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials. A wide variety of materials may  be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center ;">
    Known by its Italian name Atleta di Fano, Victorious Youth is a Greek bronze sculpture that was found in the sea of Fano on the Adriatic coast of Italy. It was built between 300 and 100 BC and is currently among the collections of the J. Paul Getty Museum in California.

  <h3>David</h3>
  
  <p>
     A masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture created between 1501 and 1504 by Michelangelo. It is a 5.17-metre (17.0 ft) marble statue of a standing male nude. The statue represents the Biblical hero David, a favoured subject in the art of Florence. Originally commissioned as one of a series of statues of prophets to be positioned along the roofline of the east end of Florence Cathedral, the statue was placed instead in a public square, outside the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of civic government in Florence, where it was unveiled on 8 September 1504.

  <h4> Alexander the Great </h4>
  <p>
    The statue of Alexander the Great was discovered inside the Pella Palace in Greece. Coated with marble patina and made of bonded marble, the statue was built in 280 BC to honor Alexander the Great, the popular Greek hero who sprawled over several parts of the world and led battles against Persian Armies, particularly in Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela. The statue of Alexander the Great is now among the Greek art collections of the Archaeological Museum of Pella in Greece.

  <h5>Winged Victory of Samothrace </h5>
    <p>
      A 200 B.C.- marble sculpture depicting the Greek goddess Nike, the Winged Victory of Samothrace is considered today as the greatest masterpiece of Hellenistic sculpture. It is currently displayed at Louvre and is among the most celebrated original statues in the world. It was created between 200 and 190 B.C. not to honor the Greek goddess Nike but to honor a sea battle. It was first erected by Macedonian general Demetrius following his naval victory in Cyprus.

  <h6> Peplos Kore </h6>
  <p>
    Recovered from the Athenian Acropolis, Peplos Kore is a stylized image of the Greek goddess Athena. Historians believe that the statue was created to serve as a votive offering during the ancient times. Made during the Archaic period of Greek art history, Peplos Kore is characterized by the stiff and formal pose of Athena, her majestic tresses and archaic smile. It initially appeared in polychrome but only traces of its original colors can be observed today.
