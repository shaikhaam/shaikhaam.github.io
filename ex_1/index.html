  <h3>Perseus and Andromeda </h3>
  <p>

Two romantic partners visible for most of the year in the northern hemisphere are Perseus and Andromeda. During his return from a successful trip to kill Medusa, Perseus spotted a beautiful young woman chained to a seaside rock. He rescued her and learned she’d been tied there by her parents, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia.

Poseidon had sent the sea monster Cetus to destroy Cepheus’s kingdom as punishment for Cassiopeia boasting about how beautiful Andromeda was. An oracle advised them to sacrifice their daughter. Perseus found another way out. He killed Cetus. Then he asked to marry Andromed.

    <h3>The Mythology of the Constellations </h3>
    <p>

Most ancient cultures saw pictures in the stars of the night sky. The earliest known efforts to catalogue the stars date to cuneiform texts and artifacts dating back roughly 6000 years. These remnants, found in the valley of the Euphrates River, suggest that the ancients observing the heavens saw the lion, the bull, and the scorpion in the stars. The constellations as we know them today are undoubtedly very different from those first few--our night sky is a compendium of images from a number of different societies, both ancient and modern. By far, though, we owe the greatest debt to the mythology of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

<h3>Stories in the Stars </h3>
    <p>

The stories of the origin of the constellations we grow up with in the Western world in general come from the Graeco-Roman tradition, with some extra ones thrown in to finish the Western pantheon when European astronomers charted the southern skies. These stories used to be well known, but with both the loss of the night sky for most people and the loss of tradition, these stories are being forgotten. The sky histories of other native people of the world as globalisation puts Western stories at the forefront are also being lost. Susanna Hislop’s book is a retelling of the stories of the main constellations in a more light hearted approach than perhaps that of the texts of the past. She also introduces some of the stories of the stars from other cultures, in particular from the Southern Hemisphere.
